ðŸ“Š Megaline Plans: A Statistical Data Analysis
Overview
This project aims to analyze customer behavior and determine which of Megaline's two prepaid plans â€” Surf or Ultimate â€” generates more revenue. By exploring user activity data for calls, text messages, and internet usage, we will identify patterns and provide data-driven insights for the company's commercial department to adjust their advertising strategies effectively.

Objective
As an analyst at Megaline, your goal is to carry out a preliminary revenue analysis based on a dataset of 500 customers. You'll evaluate how users interact with each mobile plan and calculate the monthly revenue generated by each user under the Surf and Ultimate plans. The final objective is to determine which plan is more profitable.

ðŸ“‚ Datasets Description
The project utilizes the following datasets:

calls.csv â€” Call records including user ID, date, and duration of calls.

internet.csv â€” Internet usage logs including user ID, date, and data used (in MB).

messages.csv â€” Messaging activity including user ID and date of messages sent.

plans.csv â€” Descriptions of the Surf and Ultimate prepaid plans.

users.csv â€” User details including user ID, region, and subscribed plan.

ðŸ§­ Project Strategy
Data Preparation

Load and inspect all datasets.

Convert date columns to appropriate datetime types.

Check for and handle missing values or anomalies.

Data Aggregation

Calculate monthly usage metrics per user:

Total minutes of calls.

Number of text messages.

Internet usage in MB.

Revenue Calculation

For each user and month, compute monthly revenue:

Subtract the planâ€™s free usage limits (minutes, messages, data).

Apply overage charges where applicable.

Add the monthly base fee.

User Behavior Analysis

Identify average usage patterns across plans.

Compare the number of active users per plan.

Explore regional trends in plan usage.

Hypothesis Testing

Formulate and test hypotheses to assess:

Differences in revenue between Surf and Ultimate plans.

Variations in user behavior.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Questions Addressed
Which plan generates more revenue on average?

Do users on the Ultimate plan use significantly more services than those on Surf?

Are there regional differences in the preferred plan?

What recommendations can be made for Megalineâ€™s marketing strategy?

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Statistical hypothesis testing

âœ… Outcomes
By the end of this project, we aim to provide Megaline with:

A detailed comparison of the two mobile plans.

Data-backed insights into customer usage behavior.

Recommendations on how to optimize marketing efforts based on revenue impact.

ðŸ“Œ Note
This analysis is based on a sample of 500 users and is considered preliminary. While trends can be identified, further analysis with a larger dataset may be necessary to make final business decisions.
