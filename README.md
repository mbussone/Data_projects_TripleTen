| 6 | [Zuber Ride Sharing Analysis](https://github.com/mbussone/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint06) | This project analyzes ride-sharing data for Chicago with the aim of uncovering passenger behavior, company performance, and the influence of external factors like weather on ride frequency and duration. |
| 7 | [Megaline Subscriber Plan Model](https://github.com/mbussone/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint07) | To improve customer experience and promote better usage options, the company seeks to develop a classification model that can analyze subscriber behavior and recommend one of its two new plans: Smart or Ultra. |
| 8 | [Beta Bank Customer Churn](https://github.com/mbussone/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint08) | Using historical data on customer behavior and churn, the goal is to develop a supervised learning model that predicts whether a customer will terminate their contract. |
| 9 | [Oil Region Profitability Analysis](https://github.com/mbussone/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint09) | The goal of this project is to identify the most promising oil region for investment based on machine learning predictions and profit analysis. |
| 10 | [Zyfra Prototype Gold Recovery](https://github.com/mbussone/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint10) | This project builds a machine learning model to predict gold recovery from ore during the extraction and purification process. |
| 11 | [Sure Tomorrow Insurance](https://github.com/mbussone/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint11) | Sure Tomorrow, an insurance company, is exploring how machine learning can enhance their business. |
| 12 | [Rusty Bargain Used Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/mbussone/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint12) | Rusty Bargain, a used car sales service, is developing a customer-facing app that helps users quickly estimate the market value of their car. To power this feature, we created a machine learning pipeline that predicts car prices based on historical data, including technical specs, trim, and more. |
| 13 | [Sweet Lift Taxi Demand Forecasting](https://github.com/mbussone/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint13) | Sweet Lift Taxi, a ride-hailing service, has collected historical data on hourly taxi orders at airports.
